LEGO is a programming language inspired by LOLCODE and modern English. Syntax is extremely inconventionally. 

Special thanks to Legolas Greenleaf for providing exposure to this type of modern English!

Syntax:

`btw` indiciates the start of a comment. Multi-lined comments need to have `and` at the start of each line.

```
btw this is a comment
and this is another line to the comment
```

Statements are ended with `!`.

Variables are declared with with keyword `girlboss` and assignment operator `gaslight`. `gaslight` is distinct from `gaslights` which is an equality operator.

```
girlboss string gaslight "string"!
girlboss integer gaslight 10!
girlboss boolean gaslight true!
```

Supported types are string, integer, and boolean. 

If statements are `gatekeep`. While loops are similar, but with `more`. Boolean expressions using `gaslights` and boolean variables follow. The statement is ended with `?`. If statements can have else ifs using `ono gatekeep` and else statements using `ono`. Indentation is used as opposed to curly brackets.

```
gatekeep true?
    ...
ono gatekeep true?
    ...
ono
    ...
```

```
gatekeep more true?
    ...
```

Each program is started with `omg bestie!` and ended with `im going to play minecraft`. The language is case insensitive.
