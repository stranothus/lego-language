LEGO is a programming language inspired by LOLCODE and modern English. Syntax is extremely inconventionally. 

Special thanks to Legolas Greenleaf for providing exposure to this type of modern English!

Syntax:

`btw` indiciates the start of a comment. 

To be implemented (TBI): Multi-lined comments need to have `and` at the start of each line.

```
btw this is a comment
and this is another line to the comment
```

Variables are declared with with keyword `girlboss` and assignment operator / equality checker `gaslight`.

```
girlboss gaslight "string"
girlboss gaslight 10
girlboss gaslight true
```

Supported types are the same as JavaScript and dynamically typed. 

If statements are `gatekeep`. While loops are similar, but with `more`. Boolean expressions using `gaslight` and boolean variables follow. The statement is ended with `?`. If statements can have else ifs using `ono gatekeep` and else statements using `ono`. Indentation is used as opposed to curly brackets.

```
gatekeep true?
    ...
ono gatekeep true
    ...
ono
    ...
```

```
gatekeep true?
    ...
```

Each program is started with `omg bestie!` and ended with `im going to play minecraft`. The language is case insensitive.
